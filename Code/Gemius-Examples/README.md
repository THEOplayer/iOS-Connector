# THEOPlayer 🤝 Gemius Samples

We provide source code of two sample applications that illustrate how to use the connector with different package managers:

- [Sample using **Swift Package Manager**](./SPM) (works out of the box with Xcode 12 and above)

- [Sample using **Cocoapods**](./Cocoapod) (requires Cocoapods installation through terminal)
